     <h1>About</h1>
      <p>The openSUSE Education project tried to support schools using 
      <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a>. 
      We created and described additional 
      <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Education_repositories">software-repositories</a>
      for educational projects and we created a <a href="#life">live DVD</a> from 
      the regular openSUSE distribution.</p>
      <p>As you can see in our <a href="http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/opensuse-education">timeline</a>, 
      we achieved quite a lot in the past years, had fun an joy and meet a couple of very nice people out there 
      in our spare time. But the main team members moved on to new projects, with the hope that we would one day
      find some time to work more on openSUSE-Education again. This does not seem to happen - at least not for 
      the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>While we currently still spent a lot of time to get over 460 packages in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Education">Education</a>
      project up to date and building, we could not find any volunteer to take over the maintenance of this webpage
      or the hosting of additional repositories or even someone who wants to create the next <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a> 
      media.</p>
      <p>That's not to say that openSUSE-Education is dead, at least not yet.</p>
      <p>While we still work on the packages in the Education repository, new contributors are absolutely welcome
      to take over the openSUSE-Education project and shape it to their liking.
      The old guard will be happy to assist the new volunteers wherever needed and possible.</p>
      <p>We will wait until the release of openSUSE Leap 15.0 before we will ask the openSUSE board to 
      revoke openSUSE-Education as an openSUSE project.</p>
      <p>It's been a fun ride for all of us and we very much hope that this won't be the end of 
      openSUSE-Education but instead a new beginning for this great project!</p>

	    <h2>Li-f-e</h2>
	    <p class="lead"><b>openSUSE-Edu Li-f-e</b> (Linux for Education) is a Live DVD based on 
	    <a href="https://en.opensuse.org//13.1" title="13.1" class="mw-redirect">openSUSE 13.1</a>. 
        The image is a "hybrid" iso image, the same image can be used to burn a Live DVD or to create a 
	    <a href="https://en.opensuse.org//Live_USB_stick" title="Live USB stick" class="mw-redirect">Live USB stick</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p>This release includes carefully selected software for students, educators as well as parents. 
	       The software selection encompasses everything required to make computers productive for either home 
	       or educational use without having to install anything additional.
	    </p>
	    <p>The Live DVD contains KIWI-LTSP server that can be 
	    <a href="https://en.opensuse.org//SDB:LTSP_quick_start_12.2_Edu" title="SDB:LTSP quick start 12.2 Edu">enabled even by non-technical user</a>,
	    it comes bundled with tons of useful applications from 
	    <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Education_repositories" title="Education repositories">openSUSE Education</a>,
	    <a href="https://en.opensuse.org//Portal:Build_Service" title="Portal:Build Service">Build Service</a>
	    and <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Additional_package_repositories" title="Additional package repositories">Packman</a>
	    repositories. With the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP" title="Portal:KIWI-LTSP">KIWI-LTSP</a>
	    server you can PXE(network) boot other PCs to use this live DVD without installing or modifying anything on them.
	    Booting from hard disk again will leave those PCs as they were. (Please note that running LTSP from Live DVD/USB
	    is meant for demo/testing purpose only, install on the hard disk to use it in production).
	    </p>
	    <p>The aim of this DVD is to provide complete education and development resources for parents,
	    students, teachers as well as IT admins running labs at educational institutes, if you think there
	    is something missing that you absolutely must have on the DVD, drop us a line
